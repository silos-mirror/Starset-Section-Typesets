# Starset Section Typesets

Fan-made lyric layout collection for Starset — turning the band’s narrative-driven lyrics into polished, print-ready typesets, built with [Scribus](https://www.scribus.net/) (an open-source desktop publishing software).

## What’s Included

- **Scribus Documents**: Editable `.sla` layout projects with custom text styling, spacing, and formatting tailored to each track.
- **Print-Ready PDFs**: Pre-rendered, high-quality files ready for immediate use.
- **Asset Index**: A list of third-party resources (fonts, decorative graphics, etc.) used in designs — see `NOTICE.md` for full license details.

## Getting Started

Dive right into using or editing the typesets:
- **Modify Layouts**: Install **Scribus v1.6.5+** (matching the version ensures compatibility) and open the `.sla` project files.
- **Printing/Sharing**: Use the pre-exported `.pdf` files, formatted for standard A4 paper, for both physical printing and digital sharing.

## Design Philosophy

Each typeset is crafted to mirror the *thematic tone* of its corresponding track:  
- Brooding, dark layouts for tracks like *DARK THINGS*
- Confined, cage-like visuals for *OTHER WORLD THAN THESE*

## Acknowledgments

- **Starset & Fearless Records**: For the music, lyrics, and narrative that fuels this project (all phonogram copyrights belong to Fearless Records — this is a non-commercial fan work, created with admiration and no intent to infringe).
- **Starset Community**: To fellow fans — this collection’s for anyone who wants to turn their favorite lyrics into something tangible.
